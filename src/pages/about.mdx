# About

<p>
  I am a frontend engineer living in Nagoya, Japan but originally from
  Cincinnati, Ohio. I first came to Japan in 2004 for study abroad and after
  returning to the US for one year to finish my degrees in International
  Relations and Asian Studies, I returned to Japan as an English teacher. After
  working in private and public schools for a decade, I became a self-taught
  programmer. I caught the programming bug while{" "}
  <Link href="/focusing">
    <a>automating OmniFocus</a>
  </Link>{" "}
  . After seeing what could be done with code, I learned Ruby and then Rails in
  hopes of turning my hobby into a career.
</p>

<p>
  After struggling to find enjoyment with the backend, I realized how much I
  enjoyed the frontend. While learning a bit of Laravel, I discovered{" "}
  <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Vue.js
  </a>{" "}
  and quickly fell in love. I left my job as a teacher and began working in
  frontend development. Recently interested in functional programming, I got
  into{" "}
  <a
    href="https://reasonml.github.io"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    ReasonML
  </a>{" "}
  and then{" "}
  <a
    href="https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    ReasonReact.
  </a>{" "}
  With my newfound passion for functional programming, I found that React made
  more sense to me than Vue did, beginning my love affair with React.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also deeply passionate about{" "}
  <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    the Tailwind approach to CSS
  </a>
  . I've written a <a
    href="https://github.com/brandonpittman/tailwindcss-plugin-fancy"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer author"
  >
    number of Tailwind plugins
  </a> and promote the usage of atomic, functional, and utility-driven CSS whenever
  and wherever possible.
</p>

I'm married to a lovely woman whom I met by total chance at Oktoberfest in
Nagoya one lovely day in 2014. She's gorgeous, smart, and most
importantly, funny. We keep each other laughing on a daily basis and I'm
lucky to have her. No kids yet, but we're working on that.

I play video games in my free time. I love cooking, craft beer, and good
whisky. I love a good long bike ride on a nice days and I meet up with
local friends to play board games a couple times a month.

<p>

  if you need help with Tailwind CSS, I'm available for client work. You can{" "}
