## Family

I got married on June 13, 2020. My wife and I had been together for over 5
years and living together for more than 2 years. The adjustment to married
life was smoothâ€”very little changed. We're planning on having kids soon
and trying to decide if we want to live in the US or stay in Japan. This
will largely depend on my future career plans. Should I happen to find a
frontend job back in the US, we might move to there in the next couple of
years. My first child, Marcus, is due to be born in September of this year.

## Work

I'm currently working for a company that specializes in online ad sales, in
their development section. We are actively developing mutliple web apps to help
customers manage their online ad portfolios across several advertising vendors.

## Philosophy

I try to put the words of Stoics like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus
into practice on a daily basis. I am working towards being able to separate the
things I cannot control from the things I can. To not get angry over things
beyond my control. Strict towards myself, yet tolerant towards others. _Momento
mori_ has had a profound effect on me. I keep the words, "you could leave life
right now" as the wallpaper on my iPhone to remind me throughout the day that
life is short and we must make the most of it. It also serves as a warning
against mindlessly picking up my phone. ðŸ™ƒ

## Hobbies

Most of my free time is spent studying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Latin, and Ancient
Greek. The jiu jitsu came up in an attempt to focus my mind and body on
something physical while the languages are connected to my desire to read
ancient philosophy in the original languages.
