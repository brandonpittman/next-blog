# Now

<Lead date={meta.date} />

## Family

My wife and I are expecting our first child, Marcus, September of this year.

## Work

I'm starting a new job in July that I'm excited about. They value worker happiness and stability in a way none of my previous employers have.

## Philosophy

I try to put the words of Stoics like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus
into practice on a daily basis. I am working towards being able to separate the
things I cannot control from the things I can. To not get angry over things
beyond my control. Strict towards myself, yet tolerant towards others. _Momento
mori_ has had a profound effect on me. I keep the words, "you could leave life
right now" as the wallpaper on my iPhone to remind me throughout the day that
life is short and we must make the most of it. It also serves as a warning
against mindlessly picking up my phone. ðŸ™ƒ

I deleted my Twitter accountâ€”which I had since 2007â€”and it's been a wonderful change. I no longer get exposed to the doom-scrolling Twitter (and other social media platforms) encourage. I have less stuff to _keep up on_. My mental load is lighter.

## Hobbies

Most of my free time is spent studying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Latin, and Ancient
Greek. The jiu jitsu came up in an attempt to focus my mind and body on
something physical while the languages are connected to my desire to read
ancient philosophy in the original languages.
