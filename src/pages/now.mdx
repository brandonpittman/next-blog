## Family

I got married on June 13, 2020. My wife and I had been together for over 5
years and living together for more than 2 years. The adjustment to married
life was smooth—very little changed. We're planning on having kids soon
and trying to decide if we want to live in the US or stay in Japan. This
will largely depend on my future career plans. Should I happen to find a
frontend job back in the US, we might move to there in the next couple of
years.

## Work

I'm currently working for a company that specializes in online ad sales,
in their development section. We're currently working on v2 of our
advertisement management software platform—currently in beta and launching
the public release in February 2021.

## Side Projects

I'm working on a newsletter title _Developed in Isolation_ that chronicles
entrance to the programming world and the struggles of learning on your own
while living in a country that doesn't have English speakers to get help from.
It's a little bit about my history and a little bit about development culture
(and just culture in general) here in Japan, where I've lived for over 15
years.
